Android Studio and Firebase based user-friendly hostel management interface is designed to facilitate seamless communication between hostel administration and students.

Problem Statement
A student’s life in VIT hostel is very difficult. With problems existing in student’s life such as; registering a complaint to the Chief Warden follows a tedious process shuffling from one office to another. The mess feedback process exists in manual mode and not recorded properly. Improper management of faculty, organization, department details. We aim to make this digital platform mobile and easy to use with a simple user interface. The existing digital platforms require many things such as a machine and internet connection. We will also try to overcome that. 

Requirement Analysis
Hardware Interfaces 
Our app is supported through all devices such as mobiles, tablets etc. Our webapp simply uses two hardware components that are common to all devices i.e., the display(screen) and the selector (touchpad or mouse). Apart from this to communicate the data from the client to the server, routers, repeaters, and wires are used. To communicate this data and identify user’s interactions we use Java to identify the button clicks and invoke functionalities according to the user’s actions. To process the data sent by the user we use Firebase for backend.
Software Interfaces 
The operating Systems that our app will be functional on will be any android device. The database will be made through Firebase. For frontend we will be using Java. The platform being used is Android Studio.
